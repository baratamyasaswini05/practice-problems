The lengths of their favorite strings are the same,n . Mingling two strings,P=p(1)p(2)....p(n)  and Q=q(1)q(2).....q(n), both of length n, will result in the creation of a new string R of length 2xn. It will have the following structure:

R=p(1)q(1)p(2)q(2).....p(n)q(n)

You are given two strings  P(Pawel's favorite) and  Q(Shaka's favorite), determine the mingled string R.
