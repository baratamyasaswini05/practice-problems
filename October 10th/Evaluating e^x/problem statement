The series expansion of e^x is given by:
1 + x + (x^2)/2! + (x^3)/3! + ......
 

Evaluate e^x for given values of x by using the above expansion for the first 10 terms.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N, the number of test cases.
N lines follow. Each line contains a value of x for which you need to output the value of e^x using the above series expansion. These input values have exactly 4 decimal places each.

Output Format

Output N lines, each containing the value of e^x, computed by your program.

Constraints
1<=N<=50
-20.00<=x<=20.00


Var, Val in Scala and def and defn in Clojure are blocked keywords. The challenge is to accomplish this without either mutable state or direct declaration of local variables.
