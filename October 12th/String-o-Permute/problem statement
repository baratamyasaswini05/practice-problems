Kazama gave Shaun a string of even length, and asked him to swap the characters at the even positions with the next character. Indexing starts at 0.

Formally, given a string str of length L where L is even, Shaun has to swap the characters at position i and i+1, where i belongs to {0,2,...,L-2}.

For example, if str = "abcdpqrs",L=8 . We have to swap the characters at positions:
{(0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7)}

So, answer will be "badcqpsr".

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.
T lines follow, each containing some string str.

Output Format

For each test case, print the new string as explained in the problem statement.

Constraints
1<=T<=10
1<L<= 10 pow 5


L is even
str consists of lowercase English characters, {a-z}.
