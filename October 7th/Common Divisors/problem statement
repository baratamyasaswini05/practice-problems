Mario and Luigi earn points in their steps to save the Princess Peach from a dragon. Let's denote Mario's points by M and Luigi's by L. Princess Peach is wondering how many postive integers are there that are divisors to both numbers, M and L. Help her find the answer.

Input
First line of input contains an integer, T, which represent the number of test cases. Then follows T lines. Each line contains two space separated integers, M L, representing the points earned by Mario and Luigi, respectively.

Output
For each test case, print the solution in different lines.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= L, M <= 10^8
L, M are integers
