Scturtle likes strings very much. He is getting bored today, because he has already completed this week's task and doesn't have anything else to do. So he starts left-rotating a string. If the length of the string is , then he will rotate it  times and note down the result of each rotation on a paper.

For a string S=s(1)s(2)s(3)....s(n), n rotations are possible. Let's represent these rotations by r(1),r(2),....,r(n). Rotating it once will result in string r(1)=s(2)s(3)...s(n)s(1), rotating it again will result in string r(2)=s(3)s(4)...s(n)s(1)s(2) and so on. Formally, ith rotation will be equal to r(i)=s(i+1)...s(n-1)s(n)s(1)...s(i). Note that r(n)=S.

Your task is to display all n rotations of string S.

For example, if  S = abc then it has 3 rotations. They are r(1) = bca, r(2) = cab and r(3) = abc.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T , which represents the number of test cases to follow. Then follows T lines, which represent a test case each.
Each test case contains a string,S , which consists of lower case latin characters ('a'-'z') only.

Output Format
For each test case, print all the rotations,r(1) r(2) ...r(n) , separated by a space.

Constraints
1<=T<=10
1<=n<=10 pow 2

 will consist of lower case latin character,  only.
