Given two integers,  and , a recursive technique to find their GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.

The algorithm states that, for computing the GCD of two positive integers  and , if  and  are equal, . Otherwise  if . There are a few optimizations that can be made to the above logic to arrive at a more efficient implementation.

Task
Given the starter code, you need to complete a function body that returns the GCD of two given integers  and .
The task of reading in input and printing the output will be handled by us.

Programming Language Support
At this point of time, we have a template for Scala. This means that we provide the code required to accept the input and display the output.

Input Format

One line of input containing  space separated integers.

Constraints


Output Format

Output one integer, the GCD of the two given numbers.
