Given two integers, x and y, a recursive technique to find their GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.

The algorithm states that, for computing the GCD of two positive integers x and y, if x and y are equal, GCD(x,y)=x . Otherwise GCD(x,y)=GCD(x-y,y) if x>y . There are a few optimizations that can be made to the above logic to arrive at a more efficient implementation.

Task
Given the starter code, you need to complete a function body that returns the GCD of two given integers x and y.
The task of reading in input and printing the output will be handled by us.

Programming Language Support
At this point of time, we have a template for Scala. This means that we provide the code required to accept the input and display the output.

Input Format

One line of input containing 2 space separated integers.

Constraints
1<=a,b<=10 pow 8

Output Format

Output one integer, the GCD of the two given numbers.
